- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jjr750
- 👀 I’m interested in supporting the Git Hub community so the work of security for everyone can continue.  I am fascinated with how software is coded to bring to
electronics to life.  I have always taken it for granted and now would like to learn and pay forward for all the "free" open source applications I have enjoyed in the past. This is an amazing coming together of people who care about the end users security and well being.   Hats off to this community...
- 🌱 I’m currently starting at the lowest levels but I have a lot of free time to research and learn.  I am just following along and taking one application at a time but hope to grow towards being able to hunt security flaws to safeguard against them being exploited.   I look forward to being a fly on the wall and maybe being more active in the future.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with the community at this point on open source that I use everyday for learning.  ..
- 📫 How to reach me.  I am at secxchg1001@proton.com.  ...
